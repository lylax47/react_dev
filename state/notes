- constructor is similar to python init.
- as in python super also runs parent class constructor.
- why can't state be accessed witout super call? Why do you need to pass props?
- never directly manipulate the state
    - use this.setState
    - don't call in constructor or render.
    - asynchronous - react will control when state is updated. It's a request not an immediate command.


STATE vs props
- State = mutable, stores changing component data
- Props = imutable, stores component configuration

- Normally have smart stateful parent component which passes stateful information down to children as props.
- This is called "downward dataflow"
