1. event handlers
    - method binding with this
    - pass event handlers as props
    - key prop when mapping through data

2. event types:
    - on key up
    - on key down

3. event vars are passed into all event handlers as special react objects

4. method binding
    1. use bind in line  this.function.bind(this){}
    2. arrow function  () => this.function(){}
    3. bind in the constructor
    4. function = () => {}

5. parent should define the function
    - fuction then passed to prop as child component
    - child component then invokes prop
    - parent function called to change state

6. Naming Conventions
    - parent->action, child-> handleAction

7. lists and keys
    - keys help react identify which items have been changed, are added, or are removed
    - keys need to be unique
    - use string that uniquely identifies item among siblings
    - could use index as a last resort
    - uuid
