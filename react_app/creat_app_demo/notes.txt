Webpack
    - CRA is built on top of webpack
    - enables module importing and exporting
        - packages all css/images/js into a single browser file
        - reduces the number of http request and helps performance
    - hot reloding: when src file changes auto reload.
        - tries to relaod only relevant files
    - easy testing and deployment.


modules
    - export default <function name> (without parenthesis)
    - import <function name> from "<module>" (make sure local module has relative path)
    - default implies the default thing to be exported when called.
    - if multiple functions then use {<function1>, <function2>, <function3>}
    - if default adn multiple use import <function1> {<function2>, <function3>}
        - import React, { Component } from "react";
        - use default when it makes sense to export one main thing (most important thing)
        - you never need to do this.
