Components:
    1. each react component goes in separate file
        - src/Car.js
    2. each component is capitalized
    3. components should be exported as default
    4. components always extend Component from React
        - this means you should import from react
        - import 'React', { Component } from 'react';
        - class App extends Component {}
    5. top component should be called App in App.js
